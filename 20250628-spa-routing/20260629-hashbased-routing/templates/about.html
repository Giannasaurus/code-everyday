    <h1>About us</h1>
    <p>Ada Lovelace, Silvia Plath, and Vera Rubin are like the code, poetry, and dark matter of inspiration.
        Ada Lovelace wrote the first lines of computer poetry, weaving logic into the loom of possibility.
        Silvia Plath gave voice to the hidden variables of the heart, her words orbiting emotion like planets around
        a sun.
        Vera Rubin revealed the unseen forces that hold galaxies—and dreams—together, showing us that what's
        invisible can shape the universe.
        Together, they remind us that creativity, feeling, and curiosity are the true engines of discovery. </p>
