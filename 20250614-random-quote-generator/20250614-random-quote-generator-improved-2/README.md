# Problems & Solutions
1. **Problem: Gradient animation did not look like a shine or was not smooth.** <br/>
Solution: Use a multi-stop linear gradient with a semi-transparent color for the shine, animate background-position on hover, and adjust background-size for a smooth effect.

2. **Problem: .button-light-theme class was not applying to buttons.** <br/>
Solution: Ensure the class is added to button elements in the HTML or via JavaScript using classList.add() or classList.toggle().

3. **Problem: Theme toggle did not update button or icon styles as expected.** <br/>
Solution: Use a persistent variable (e.g., isLightTheme) outside the function to track state, and update all relevant elements and icons inside the toggle function.

4. **Problem: Could not set .src on a button element.** <br/>
Solution: Only set .src on <img> elements, not buttons. If the image is inside a button, select the <img> with querySelector('img') and update its src.

5. **Problem: Removing the last card did not work as expected.** <br/>
Solution: Use document.querySelectorAll('.card-style') to select all cards and call .remove() on the last one.

6. **Problem: generateQuote did not produce unique quotes.** <br/>
Solution: Declare usedIndexes outside the function so it persists between calls, ensuring each quote is only used once until all have been shown.

8. **Problem: CSS transform animation was too fast or too slow.** <br/>
Solution: Adjust the transition propertyâ€™s duration (e.g., transition: transform 0.5s;) in your CSS for the desired speed.
