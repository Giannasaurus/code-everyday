# Problems & Solutions
1. Problem: align-items: flex-start; did not apply as expected. <br/>
Solution: Check if the container uses `display: grid` or `display: flex`. For grid, use `align-items: start;` instead of `flex-start`.

2. Problem: #cardWrapper did not fill the remaining vertical space. <br/>
Solution: Set html, body, and parent containers to `height: 100%`, and use `flex: 1` or `height: 100%` on **#cardWrapper** when using a flex column layout.

3. Problem: Author text would not align to the bottom of the card. <br/>
Solution: Use `display: flex;` `flex-direction: column;` on the card and `margin-top: auto;` on the author text, or use `position: absolute;` `bottom: ...;` with `position: relative;` on the card.

4. Problem: text-align: right stopped working for the author text. <br/>
Solution: Ensure **.author-text-style** has `width: 100%` and is not overridden by other CSS. Check for specificity issues or parent containers affecting alignment. Use browser DevTools to debug.
